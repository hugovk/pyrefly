# Pyrefly in the IDE
Pyrefly seamlessly integrates into IDEs with our [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) and [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/meta/pyrefly) extensions. For other editors like vim/emacs, see [other editors](#other-editors).

## Quick start
1. Install the Pyrefly extension from the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/meta/pyrefly)
2. Open a python file and the extension will activate

## Features
The Pyrefly extension provides:
- Inline type errors matching the Pyrefly command-line
- Types shown inline and on hover
- Go-to definition
- Autocomplete / intellisense
- Basic document symbols / breadcrumbs
- Find references

## Customization
By default, Pyrefly should work in the IDE with no configuration necessary. But to ensure your project is set up properly, see [configurations](../configuration).

The following configuration options are IDE-specific and exposed as VSCode settings:
- `python.pyrefly.disableLanguageServices` [boolean: false]: by default, Pyrefly will provide both type errors and other language features like go-to definition, intellisense, hover, etc. Enable this option to keep type errors from Pyrefly unchanged but use VSCode's Python extension for everything else.
- `python.pyrefly.disableTypeErrors` [boolean: false]: by default, Pyrefly will provide type errors in your project. Enable this setting to disable type error squiggles appearing in the editor.

If the project configuration does not specify the Python interpreter, Pyrefly will use the [interpreter selected in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).

## Issues?
If you experience issues with the Pyrefly extension, please create an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) on github.

## Other Editors
Support for other editors is community-driven. If you would like to set this up, please contribute.

### Jetbrains
An unofficial Jetbrains extension has been developed [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26829-pyrefly)

### Neovim + `lspconfig`
With the `lspconfig` [plugin](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and `uv` installed, you can use this configuration:
```lua
local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")
local configs = require("lspconfig.configs")

if not configs.pyrefly then
  configs.pyrefly = {
      cmd = { "uv", "run", "pyrefly", "lsp" },
      filetypes = { "python" },
      root_dir = function(fname)
        return lspconfig.util.find_git_ancestor(fname) or vim.loop.os_homedir()
      end,
      settings = {},
    },
end

lspconfig.pyrefly.setup({})
```

### Neovim 0.11+
Place the following file under `~/.config/nvim/lsp`
```lua
return {
  cmd = { "pyrefly", "lsp" },
  filetypes = { "python" },
  settings = {},
  on_exit = function(code, _, _)
    vim.notify("Closing Pyrefly LSP exited with code: " .. code, vim.log.levels.INFO)
  end,
}
```
Then enable it in `init.lua`:
```lua
vim.lsp.enable({"pyrefly"})
```

### Vim + Ale
Once [this](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/pull/4972) gets merged, you will only need:
```
let g:ale_linters = {
    ...
  \ 'python': ['pyrefly'],
    ...
  \ }
```

# Pyrefly Configuration

Pyrefly has a basic configuration that can (or will) allow you to customize your
Pyrefly runs without having to specify all of your arguments on the command
line.

NOTE: this is early in its development, so the options listed here are subject
to change in name, usage, type, quantity, and structure.

Configurations can be specified in a [TOML file](https://toml.io/en/) at the root of
your project (or elsewhere, as long as the path-based config options point to the right place) named
`pyrefly.toml`, with all configuration options in the top-level of the document.
You can also specify a configuration in a `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.pyrefly]`
section. Other config names can be used when explicitly passing in the config file
name with the `--config`/`-c` flag, but they will not be automatically found by
[Configuration Finding](#configuration-finding).

Both absolute and config-relative paths are supported.

## Precedence in Options

[Configuration options](#configuration-options) are selected in the following order

1. CLI flags
  1. Examples: `--project-excludes <value>`, `--python-version <value>`
2. Environment variable overrides -- this is the same as `PYREFLY_<config option name>`
  1. Examples: `export PROJECT_EXCLUDES=<value>`, `PYTHON_VERSION=<value> pyrefly ...`
3. Configuration options
  1. Examples: (in a `pyrefly.toml`) `project_excludes = <value>`, `python_version = <value>`
4. Pyrefly defaults
  1. See [Default `pyrefly.toml`](#default-pyreflytoml) for the default values used

## Type Checking Modes

Pyrefly has two different modes it can run in when type checking your project, which
correspond to different but useful ways we expect most people to interact with Pyrefly:

- **Project** mode: attempt to load a config, falling back to Pyrefly's default config when
  none can be found, and type check using that one config. This involves getting the
  [`project_includes`](#project_includes) and [`project_excludes`](#project_excludes) from the file, expanding the patterns,
  and type checking on those files.
  - Project mode is used whenever no files are provided with the CLI invocation.
- **Per-file** or **Single-file** mode: when given [`FILES...`](#project_includes) (and optionally [`--project-excludes`](#project_excludes))
  during a CLI invocation, expand the patterns and find the relevant config file for each
  file listed. `project_includes` and `project_excludes` are ignored from the config file,
  but it is used for all remaining config options.

## Configuration Finding

In both project checking mode and single-file checking mode (see [Type Checking Modes](#type-checking-modes)
for more info), we attempt to find a *project root* from which to check each file, both for reading
config options and for import resolution. The project root is typically the directory containing the
configuration file. More precisely:

1. If a configuration file is provided with `-c`/`--config`, we use the directory the file is located in as the directory to check.
2. If no configuration file is passed, we perform an upward file search from the 'start location' to the filesystem root,
   looking in each directory for any of the following files: `pyrefly.toml`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `setup.py`, `mypy.ini`, and `pyrightconfig.json`. If we find one, we use the directory it's found in as the containing directory.
3. If no configuration file is found, we will still attempt to resolve imports by walking up the tree looking for a matching import. For example: when
   importing `from a.b.c import q`, if our project structure
   looks like `/x/y/z/a/b/c`, we can walk up the components of `a.b.c` to find a root at
   `/x/y/z`.


Note that only `pyrefly.toml` and `pyproject.toml` are parsed for config options, but we look for
additional files that mark the root of a project to aid import resolution.

For project checking mode, the 'start location' is current working directory. For single-file checking mode,
the start location is the directory containing each file to be type checked, and
we find the config for each file matched by the pattern provided.

If a `pyrefly.toml` is found, it is parsed and used for type checking, and will
return an error to the user on invalid types, syntax, values, or unknown config options.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found, Pyrefly will use the `[tool.pyrefly]`
section if it exists, otherwise it will assume a default config.
The same errors will be returned as when loading a `pyrefly.toml` if
the config is invalid.

### Providing a Config in Single-File Mode

Providing `-c`/`--config` in single-file checking mode disables the upward file search for config
files. All options are read from the provided config file except `project_includes` and
`project_excludes`, which are ignored.

## Configuration Options

The following section lists all recognized options that can be specified in a config
file or `pyproject.toml` Pyrefly config section.

### `project_includes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to type
check, typically understood as user-space files.

This does not specify
[Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx) priority or the path an
import should be resolved from. See [`search_path`](#search_path) instead.

- Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
- Default: `["**/*.py", "**/*.pyi"]`
- Flag equivalent: `FILES...` argument
- Equivalent configs: `include` in Pyright, `files`/`modules`/`packages` in
  mypy
- Notes:
  - When overridden by passing in `FILES...`, we do not consult the
    relevant config file for what to use for `project_excludes`. If
    `project_excludes` should not use the default value, override it with the flag as
    well.
  - When a `project_includes` pattern does not match any files, we will return
    an error.
  - If you get an error about no matches for a directory when passing a glob as a CLI
    argument, try wrapping the glob in quotes to prevent eager shell glob expansion.

### `project_excludes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to avoid
type checking as way to filter files that match `project_includes`,
but we don't want to type check.

- Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
- Default: `["**/.[!/.]*", "**/*venv/**"]`
- Flag equivalent: `--project-excludes`
- Equivalent configs: `exclude` in Pyright and mypy
- Notes:
  - It is an error if no files are returned from any `project_includes` because
    they are filtered out by `project_excludes` entries. We differentiate between
    an error from a `project_includes` that doesn't match any files, and an error
    from all `project_includes` getting filtered by `project_excludes`.
  - When passing in `FILES...`, we also do not consult the config file for
    what to use for `project_excludes`. If `project_excludes` should not use
    the default value, override it with a flag as well. When no `FILES...` are passed,
    `project_excludes` overrides the config's value.

### `search_path`

A file path describing the roots from which imports should be
found and imported from (including modules in [`project_includes`](#project_includes)). This takes
the [highest precedence in import order](./import-resolution.mdx#absolute-imports),
before `typeshed` and [`site_package_path`](#site_package_path). When a `project_includes`
type checked file is imported by another type checked file, we check all search roots to
determine how to import it.

- Type: list of directories specifying the root
- Default: [import root](./import-resolution.mdx#import-root)
- Flag equivalent: `--search-path`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_SEARCH_PATH`
- Equivalent configs: `extraPaths` in Pyright, `mypy_path` in mypy
- Notes:
  - We automatically append an import root (typically the directory containing the
    configuration file) to the `search_roots` when type checking as a sensible
    default and last attempt at an import.
  - Libraries should not be listed here, since they may override `typeshed`
    values for your whole project, and have different import semantics with
    respect to typing. See
    [Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx)
    for more information about how modules are imported.

### `site_package_path`

A file path describing a root from which imports should
be found and imported from. This takes the lowest priority in import
resolution, after [`search_path`](#search_path) and `typeshed`.

`site_package_path` entries have special rules around when they can be imported,
according to the typing specification. See
[Site Package Path Typing Rules](./import-resolution.mdx#site-package-path-typing-rules)
for more information, and [`use_untyped_imports`](#use_untyped_imports) and
[`ignore_missing_source`](#ignore_missing_source) for details on how to configure
that behavior.

- Type: list of directories
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `[]` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--site-package-path`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH`
- Equivalent configs: none

NOTE: Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
to be reused between different systems and platforms.

### `python_platform`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform)
values.

- Type: string
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  "linux" if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--python-platform`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_PLATFORM`
- Equivalent configs: `pythonPlatform` in Pyright, `platform` in mypy

### `python_version`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version)
values. The format should be `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`, where minor and
micro can be omitted to take the default positional value.

- Type: string of the format `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`
- Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `3.13.0` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
- Flag equivalent: `--python-version`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_VERSION`
- Equivalent configs: `pythonVersion` in Pyright, `python_version` in mypy

### `python_interpreter`

The Python interpreter to query when attempting to autoconfigure
Python environment values (`site_package_path`, `python_platform`, `python_version`).
See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more information.

- Type: path to executable
- Default: `$(which python3)`, then `$(which python)`, or none
- Flag equivalent: `--python-interpreter`
- ENV equivalent: `PYREFLY_PYTHON_INTERPRETER`
- Equivalent configs: `python_executable` in mypy
- Notes:
  - This executes the value present in the `python_interpreter` field without any checks. It could
    be a security risk if your `python_interpreter` is an arbitrary executable.

NOTE: Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
to be reused between different systems and platforms.

### `errors`

Configure (enable and disable) the errors Pyrefly emits. `true` (default) tells Pyrefly to
emit the error, while `false` tells Pyrefly to hide it.

- Type: Table of [error code](./error-kinds.mdx) to boolean representing enabled status
- Default: `errors = {}`/`[errors]`
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs:
  [type check rule overrides](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-rule-overrides)
  and [type evaluation settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-evaluation-settings)
  in Pyright,
  [`enable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-enable_error_code) and
  [`disable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disable_error_code)
  in mypy
- Notes: setting `<error-code> = true` is the same as having no error code configuration present, which means
  the error will be shown. Setting `<error-code> = false` will disable the error for type checking.

### `replace_imports_with_any`

[`ModuleGlob`](#module-globbing)s of modules from which import errors should be
ignored, and the module should be replaced with `typing.Any`. For example, with
`from x.y import z` in a file, adding `x.*`, `*.y`, or `x.y` to this config will
silence those import errors and replace the module with `typing.Any`. If the module can be found, its type
information will still be replaced with `typing.Any`.

- Type: list of regex
- Default: `[]`
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs: `ignore_missing_imports` or `follow_imports = skip` in mypy
- Notes:
  - `errors = {import-error = false}` (TOML inline table for `errors`) has similar behavior in Pyrefly, but ignores
    *all* import errors instead of import errors from specific modules, and won't replace findable modules with `typing.Any`.

### `ignore_errors_in_generated_code`

Whether to ignore type errors in generated code. If enabled, generated files
will be treated as if they are included in `project_excludes`.
The generated code status is determined by checking if the file contents contain
the substring '<span>&#64;</span>generated'.

- Type: bool
- Default: false
- Flag equivalent: `--ignore-errors-in-generated-code`
- ENV equivalent: `IGNORE_ERRORS_IN_GENERATED_CODE`
- Equivalent configs: none

### `use_untyped_imports`

Whether to search imports in [`site_package_path`](#site_package_path) that do not have a
`py.typed` file unconditionally. When this is true, we skip any checks for `py.typed` files,
and return the first valid import we can find. See
[Site Package Path Typing Rules](./import-resolution.mdx#site-package-path-typing-rules) for
more information on when a `site_package_path` cannot be used for typing information.

- Type: bool
- Default: true
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs: `useLibraryCodeForTypes` in Pyright, `follow_untyped_imports` in mypy

### `ignore_missing_source`

Whether to skip the check for a non-stubs package when a `-stubs` package is found in
[`site_package_path`](#site_package_path). When this is true, we immediately return
a `-stubs` package when found.

The check for a non-stubs package exists to ensure you have an importable package to use
in your project. When this check returns an import error, it means we couldn't find a package,
and that at runtime you may not actually be able to import the given package, even if its
type stubs could be found. See
[Stub Files vs Source Files](./import-resolution.mdx#stub-files-vs-source-files) for more information.

- Type: bool
- Default: true
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs: `reportMissingModuleSource` in Pyright

### `untyped_def_behavior`

How should Pyrefly treat function definitions with no parameter or return type annotations?

By default, Pyrefly uses the `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior and will
check all function bodies inferring the return type.

If this option is set to `"check-and-infer-return-any"`, then Pyrefly will still
check the function body but will treat the return type as `Any`.

If this option is set to `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`, Pyrefly will again treat
the return type as `Any`, but will also skip checking the function body. In this
case, Pyrefly will also infer `Any` as the type of any attributes inferred based
on this function body. This behavior is what PEP 484 specifies, although we do
not recommend it for most users today; since Pyrefly will not analyze the bodies
of untyped functions, language server functionality like showing types on hover
and finding definitions will not be available there.

- Type: one of `"check-and-infer-return-type"`, `"check-and-infer-return-any"`,
  `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`
- Default: `"check-and-infer-return-type"
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs:
  - The `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior emulates Pyright's default
    behavior.
  - The `"skip-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's default behavior.
  - The `"check-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's
    `check_untyped_defs` flag.

### `sub_config`

Override specific config values for matched paths in your project. See
[`SubConfigs`](#subconfigs) for more information on the structure
and values that can be overridden here.

- Type: [TOML array of tables](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables) with a [`SubConfig` structure](#subconfigs)
- Default: `[]`
- Flag equivalent: none
- ENV equivalent: none
- Equivalent configs: `executionEnvironments` in Pyright, per-module config options in mypy

## Configuration Details

This section describes some of the configuration options, behaviors, or types in more depth, when
there are details shared between multiple config options or the information is more than what
can fit under a single config option description.

### Environment Autoconfiguration

If any of [`python_platform`](#python_platform), [`python_version`](#python_version), or
[`site_package_path`](#site_package_path) are empty, we attempt to query an interpreter
for the missing values. By default we query `$(which python3)` or `$(which python)` if they're available on the path,
but the interpreter can be overridden with the [`python_interpreter`](#python_interpreter) config option and flag.
If the interpreter does not exist, we fall back to Pyrefly's defaults for all unspecified values.

The values queried from the interpreter are:
* `python_platform`: `sys.platform`
* `python_version`: `sys.version_info[:3]`
* `site_package_path`: `site.getsitepackages() + [site.getusersitepackages()]`

### Filesystem Globbing

We use a standard Unix-style glob, which allows for wildcard matching when specifying a fileset. It is similar
to regex, but more restricted given the subset of allowed syntax for paths on a filesystem. We currently only
allow matching files with a `.py` or `.pyi` suffix.

The globs provided are relative to the config, if one is found, or the current working directory otherwise.
Absolute path globs can also be provided, though this is generally not recommended, since it may not
be compatible with other systems type checking your project.

- We recognize the following wildcards:
  - `*` matches zero or more characters in a single directory component
  - `**` matches the current and any sub directories/files in those sub directories
  - `?` matches any one character
  - `[<pattern>]` matches any character or character range between the brackets (character range separated by `-`)
  - `[!<pattern>]` excludes any character or character range between the brackets and after the `!`
  - Note: `[]` can be used to match `?`, `*`, `[`, `]` literally (e.g. `[?]`), although these are invalid as part of a Python path.

We also support non-wildcard paths, so a relative (or absolute) path like `src/` will match all Python files under `src/`
or `src/my_file.py` will match `src/my_file.py` exactly.

Any directories matched will also have their `.py` and `.pyi` files recursively matched. `src/*` will match all files and
directories under `src/`, so therefore, we will recursively match everything under `src/`.

Examples:
- `src/**/*.py`: only match `.py` files under `src/`
- `src`, `src/`, `src/*`, `src/**`, and `src/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files under `src/
- `?.py` and `[A-z].py`: match any file that looks like `<letter>.py`
- `src/path/to/my/file.py`: only match `src/path/to/my/file.py`
- `src/**/tests`, `src/**/tests/`, `src/**/tests/**`, and `src/**/tests/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files in `src/`
  under a directory named `tests`

### Module Globbing

In some config options, we've added globbing for module paths. This is different from both path globs and regex,
in the sense that we're performing a match on a Python dotted import, such as `this.is.any.module`.
The only wildcard we recognize is `*`, which represents zero or more segments of a module path, unless it starts a glob,
in which case it must match one or more segments. The wildcard must be surrounded
by `.`, unless it is at the start or end of a module glob.

Examples:
- `this.is.a.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is\.a\.module`. It will only match imports that look like
`this.is.a.module`.
- `this.is.*.module` would become `^this\.is(\..+)*\.module$`. It would match:
  - `this.is.module`
  - `this.is.a.module`
  - `this.is.a.really.long.path.to.a.module`
- `*.my.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^.+\.my\.module$`.
  - It would match:
    - `this.is.my.module`
    - `heres.my.module`
  - It will not match:
    - `my.module`
- `this.is.*` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is(\..+)*`. It would match:
  - `this.is.my.module`
  - `this.is`

### `SubConfigs`

`SubConfigs` are a method for overriding one or more config options for specific files based on
filepath glob matching. Only certain config options are allowed to be overridden, and a need
to override other configs means you likely need to use a separate config file for your subdirectory.
You can have as many `SubConfigs` as you want in a project, and even multiple separate `SubConfigs`
that can apply to a given file when the `matches` glob pattern matches.

#### `SubConfig` Allowed Overrides

We currently allow the following config options to be overridden in a `SubConfig`:
- `errors`
- `replace_imports_with_any`
- `untyped_def_behavior`
- `ignore_errors_in_generated_code`

All `SubConfig` overrides *replace* the values appearing in the 'root' or top-level of the
Pyrefly configuration.

Any configs that change the list of files we're type checking, Python environment, or where we look
for imports cannot be included in `SubConfigs`. Some other configs we also do not include because
we think they make it difficult to reason about your project type checks, but you can
[open an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or make a pull request if you disagree
and would like to see the option supported.

#### `SubConfig` Table Structure

A `SubConfig` has two or more entries:
- a `matches` key, with a [Filesystem Glob](#filesystem-globbing) detailing which files the config
  applies to.
- at least one of the [`SubConfig` allowed overrides](#subconfig-allowed-overrides)

#### `SubConfig` Option Selection

Since you can have more than one `SubConfig` matching a file, we need to define a resolution order
to determine which `SubConfig`'s option should be selected. Pyrefly does this by filtering
`SubConfig`s whose `matches` does not match the given file, then takes the first non-null
value that can be found in the order the `SubConfig`s appear in your configuration.

If no `SubConfig`s match, or there are no non-null config options present, then we take
the value in the 'root'/top-level Pyrefly config (or Pyrefly default if no value is specified).

### Conda and Venv Support

We plan on adding extra automatic support for [Conda](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/2)
and [Venv](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/1) at some point soon, but we haven't made
it around to doing this yet. If you would like to import packages from these in the meantime,
you can follow the following steps.

### Venv

If you have a venv set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your venv sourced
in your shell (`source .venv/bin/activate`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages. To pick
up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can add `.venv/bin/python3` (or
`<path_to_venv>/bin/python3`) to your Pyrefly configuration under
[`python_interpreter`](#python_interpreter) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter` flag.

### Conda

If you have conda set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your Conda environment
sourced in your shell (`conda activate <environment>`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages.
To pick up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can query your environment's install
location with `conda env list`, and add `<conda_environment_path>/bin/python3` to your Pyrefly configuration
under [`python_interpreter`](#python_interpreter) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter` flag.

## Example Configuration

This section displays an example config showing the usage of all config options listed above to make creating
your own easier, and to give you an easy place to start.

### Default `pyrefly.toml`

This is a configuration with the Pyrefly defaults. If you have an
interpreter installed, some of these values may be overridden.

```toml
###### configuring what to type check and where to import from

# check all files in "."
project_includes = ["."]
# exclude dotfiles
project_excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*"]
# import project files from "."

title: Error Kinds

description: Pyrefly error categories and suppression codes
---

# Error Kinds

An _error kind_ categorizes an error by the part of the typing specification
that an error is related to. Every error has exactly one kind.

The main use of error kinds is as short names ("slugs") that can be used in
error suppression comments.

## annotation-mismatch

This error indicates a mismatch between multiple annotations for a single
variable. This is relatively uncommon, but it can happen in if-statements:

```python
if some_cond:
    x: int = 1
else:
    x: str = "two" # Inconsistent type annotations for x: str, int [annotation-mismatch]
```

It can be helpful to annotate the variable before branch, especially if there is
a useful default value for it. For example:

```python
x: str = "default"
if some_cond:
  x = "actual value"
```

## assert-type

An `assert-type` error is raised when a `typing.assert_type()` call fails.

This error kind should never be suppressed, since that rather defeats the point
of of `typing.assert_type()`.

## async-error

`async-error` is reported when attempting to `await` on something that is not
awaitable. This may indicate that a function should have been marked `async` but
wasn't.

```python
def some_func() -> None:
  ...

await some_func() # Expression is not awaitable [async-error]
```

This will also arise if the context manager used in an `async with` statement
has `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods that are not marked `async`.

The fix is to use an `async` function in the `await`. This may mean making the
function `async` or finding an existing `async` function to use instead.

## bad-argument-count

This error arises when a function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

```python
def takes_three(one: int, two: int, three: int) -> complex:
  ...

take_three(3, 2)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
```

Note that `missing-argument` will be raised if pyrefly can identify that
specific arguments are missing. As such, this error is more likely to appear
when too many args are supplied, rather than too few.

This example shows both kinds of errors:

```python
from typing import Callable
def apply(f: Callable[[int, int], int]) -> int:
    return f(1)  # Expected 1 more positional argument [bad-argument-count]
apply() # Missing argument `f` in function `apply` [missing-argument]
```

## bad-argument-type

This error indicates that the function was called with an argument of the wrong
type.

```python
def example(x: int) -> None:
  ...
example("one")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter `x` with type `int` in function `example` [bad-argument-type]
```

This can also happen with `*args` and `**kwargs`:

```python
def bad_args(*args: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(1, "two")  # Argument `Literal['two']` is not assignable to parameter with type `int` in function `bad_args` [bad-argument-type]
```

```python
def bad_kwargs(**kwargs: int) -> None:
  ...

bad_args(x=1, y="two")  # Keyword argument `y` with type `Literal['two']` is not assignable to kwargs type `int` in function `bad_kwargs` [bad-argument-type]
```

## bad-assignment

The most common cause of this error is attempting to assign a value that conflicts with the variable's type annotation.

```python
x: str = 1 # `Literal[1]` is not assignable to `str` [bad-assignment]
```

However, it can occur in several other situations.

Here, `x` is marked as `Final`, so assigning a new value to it is an error.

```python
from typing import Final
x: Final = 1
x = 2 # `x` is marked final [bad-assignment]
```

In another case, attempting to annotate an assignment to an instance attribute raises this error.

```python
class A:
    x: int
a = A()
a.x: int = 2  # Type cannot be declared in assignment to non-self attribute `a.x` [bad-assignment]
```

## bad-class-definition

This error indicates that there is something wrong with the class definition.
It tends to be a bit rarer, since most issues would be tagged with other error kinds, such as
`annotation-mismatch` or one of the function errors.
inheritance has its own complexities, so it has its own error kind called `invalid-inheritance`.

One place you may see it is dynamic class generation:

```python
from enum import Enum
Ex = Enum("Ex", [("Red", 1), ("Blue", 2), ("Red", 3)])  # Duplicate field `Red` [bad-class-definition]
```

However, it is best practice to use the class syntax if possible, which doesn't treat duplicate names as an error.

## bad-function-definition

Like `bad-class-definition`, this error kind is uncommon because other error kinds are used for more specific issues.
For example, argument order is enforced by the parser, so `def f(x: int = 1, y: str)` is a `parse-error`.

## bad-keyword-argument

bad-keyword-argument pops up when a keyword argument is given multiple values:

```python
def f(x: int) -> None:
  pass
f(x=1, x=2)
```

However, this is often accompanied by a `parse-error` for the same issue.

## bad-override

When a subclass overrides a field or method of its base class, care must be taken that the override won't cause problems.

Some of these are obvious:

```python
class Base:
  def f(self, a: int) -> None:
    pass

class NoArg(Base):
  def f(self) -> None:
    pass

class WrongType(Base):
  def f(self, a: str) -> None:
    pass

def uses_f(b: Base) -> None:
  b.f(1)
```

These errors are rather obvious: `uses_f` will fail if given a `NoArg` or `WrongType` instance, because those methods don't expect an `int` argument!

The guiding idea here is the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle), the idea that a subclass can stand in for a base class at any point without breaking the program.

This can be a little subtle at first blush. Consider:

```python
class Base:
  def f(self, a: int) -> None:
    pass

class Sub(Base):
  def f(self, a: float) -> None:
    pass
```

Is this OK? Yes! `int` is treated as a subclass of `float`, or to put it another way, a function that accepts `float` can accept every `int`.
That means everywhere that we call `Base.f` can safely call `Sub.f`.

The opposite case, where `Base.f` takes `float` and `Sub.f` takes `int`, is an error because `Sub.f` cannot accept every `float` value.

## bad-return

Arises when a function does not return a value that is compatible with the function's return type annotation.

```python
def bad_return() -> None:
  return 1
```

Real-world examples are often less obvious, of course, due to complex control flow and type relationships.

This error is also raised for generator functions:

```python
from typing import Generator
# Generator has 3 types: the yield, send, and return types.
def bad_gen() -> Generator[int, None, str]:
  yield 1
  return 2  # should be a str!
```

## bad-specialization

"Specialization" refers to instantiating a generic type with a concrete type.
For example, `list` is a generic type, and `list[int]` is that type specialized with `int`.

Each generic type has an expected number of type vars, and each type var can be bound or constrained.
Attempting to use specialize a generic type in a way that violates these specifications will result in a `bad-specialization` error:

```python
x: list[int, str]
```

## bad-unpacking

An error caused by unpacking, such as attempting to unpack a list, tuple, or iterable into the wrong number of variables.

```python
def two_elems() -> tuple[int, str]:
  return (1, "two")

a, b, c = two_elems()
```

Note that pyrefly can only report this error if it knows how many elements the thing being unpacked has.

```python
# A bare `tuple` could have any number of elements
def two_elems() -> tuple:
  return (1, "two")

a, b, c = two_elems()
```

## delete-error

This error occurs when attempting to `del` something that cannot be deleted.

Besides obvious things like built-in values (you can't `del True`!), some object attributes are protected from deletion.
For example, read-only and required `TypedDict` fields cannot be deleted.

## import-error

An error related to the import mechanism, such as when a module cannot be found.

The error message will include which paths were searched, such as the site package paths.
You may be missing a dependency, or you may need to inform Pyrefly where the module lives. See [Configuration](configuration.mdx) for further information.

## index-error

Attempting to access a container with an incorrect index.
This only occurs when Pyrefly can statically verify that the index is incorrect, such as with a fixed-length tuple.

```python
def add_three(x: tuple[int, int]) -> int:
  return x[0] + x[1] + x[2]
```

Pyrefly also knows the keys of `TypedDict`s, but those have their own error kind.

## internal-error

Ideally you'll never see this one. If you do, please consider [filing a bug](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).

## invalid-annotation

There are several reasons why an annotation may be invalid. The most common case is misusing a typing special form, such as `typing.Final`, `typing.ClassVar`, `typing.ParamSpec`, and so on.

```python
from typing import *

# Final must have a value
a: Final
# ClassVar can only be used in a class body
b: ClassVar[int] = 1
```

The error messages will explain how the special form is being misused. Consult the [typing docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and [typing spec](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/) for more information.

## invalid-argument

This error is used to indicate an issue with an argument to special typing-related functions.

For example, `typing.NewType` is a handy special form for creating types that are distinct from a base type.


```python
from typing import *

# The first arg must match the name!
Mismatch = NewType("Wrong Name", int)

# NewTypes cannot be used in isinstance.
UserId = NewType("UserId", int)
if isinstance(1, UserId):
  ...
```

## invalid-inheritance

An error caused by incorrect inheritance in a class or type definition.
This can pop up in quite a few cases:
- Trying to subclass something that isn't a class.
- Subclassing a type that does not support it, such as a `NewType` or a `Final` class.
- Attempting to mix `Protocol`s with non-`Protocol` base classes.
- Trying to make a generic enum.
- Trying to give a `TypedDict` a metaclass.

And so on!

## invalid-literal

`typing.Literal` only allows a [limited set](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/literal.html#legal-parameters-for-literal-at-type-check-time) of types as parameters.
Attempting to use `Literal` with anything else is an error.

```python
from typing import Literal

# These are legal
Literal[1.0]
Literal['a', 'b', 'c']
# This is not
class A:
  ...
Literal[A()]
```

## invalid-overload

The `@overload` decorator requires that the decorated function has at least two overloaded signatures and a base implementation.

```python
from typing import *

@overload
def no_base(x: int) -> None:
  pass

@overload
def no_base(x: str) -> int:
  pass
```

```python
@overload
def just_one(x: int) -> None:
  pass

def just_one(x: str) -> None:
  ...
```


## invalid-param-spec

This error is reported when `typing.ParamSpec` is defined incorrectly or misused. For example:

```python
from typing import *

P = ParamSpec("Name Must Match!")

P1 = ParamSpec("P1")
P2 = ParamSpec("P2")

def f(x, *args: P1.args, **kwargs: P2.kwargs) -> None:
  pass
```

Here, `P1.args` and `P2.kwargs` can't be used together; `*args` and `**kwargs` must come from the same `ParamSpec`.

## invalid-super-call

`super()` has [a few restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) on how it is called.

`super()` can be called without arguments, but only when used inside a method of a class:

```python
class Legal(Base1, Base2):
  def f(self) -> None:
    super().f()

def illegal(arg: SomeType) -> None:
  super().f()
```

When the function is called with two arguments, like `super(T, x)`, then `T` must be a type, and the second argument is either an object where `isinstance(x, T)` is true
or a type where `issubclass(x, T)` is true.

## invalid-syntax

This error covers syntactical edge cases that are not flagged by the parser.

For example:

```python
x: list[int] = [0, 2, 3]
x[0]: int = 1
```

It's not a parse error for an assignment to have an annotation, but it is forbidden by the type checker to annotate assignment to a subscript like `x[0]`.

## invalid-type-var

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVar. A few examples:

```python
from typing import TypeVar
# Old-style TypeVars must be assigned to a matching variable.
Wrong = TypeVar("Name")

# PEP 695-style TypeVars can be constrained, but there must be at least two:
def only_one_constriant[T: (int,)](x: T) -> T:
  ...

# It's also illegal to mix the two styles together.
T = TypeVar("T")
def mixed[S](a: S, b: T) -> None:
  ...
```

## invalid-type-var-tuple

An error caused by incorrect usage or definition of a TypeVarTuple.

TypeVarTuple has similar error cases to [TypeVar](#invalid-type-var), but also a few of its own. For example:

```python
from typing import TypeVarTuple

Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")

# TypeVarTuples must always be unpacked:
bad: tuple[Ts] = (...)
good: tuple[*Ts] = (...)

# Only one TypeVarTuple is allowed in a list of type arguments:
def two_tups[*Xs, *Ys](xs: tuple[*Xs], ys: tuple[*Ys]) -> None:
  ...
```

## invalid-yield

This error arises when `yield` is used in a way that is not allowed. For example:

```python
from typing import Generator

for _ in range(1, 10):
  yield "can't yield outside of a function!"

def bad_yield_from() -> Generator[int, None, None]:
  # `yield from` can only be used with iterables.
  yield from 1
```

## match-error

This error is used in two cases.

The first is when there is an issue with a `match` statement. For example, `Ex` only has 2 fields but the `case` lists 3:

```python
class Ex:
  __match_args__ = ('a', 'b')
  def __init__(self, a: int, b: str) -> None:
    self.a = a
    self.b = b

def do(x: Ex) -> None:
  match x:
    case Ex(a, b, c):
      print("This is an error")
```

It is also used when `__match_args__` is defined incorrectly. It must be a tuple of the names of the class's attributes as literal strings.
For class `Ex` in the previous example, `__match_args__ = ('a', 'c')` would be an error because `Ex.c` does not exist.

## missing-argument

An error caused by calling a function without all the required arguments.

```python
def takes_two(x: int, y: int) -> int:
  return x + y

takes_two(1)
```

## missing-attribute

This error is raised when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on the given object or module.

In the case of modules, attempting to import an nonexistent name will raise [`missing-module-attribute](#missing-module-attribute) instead.

```python
import os
from os import bacarat  # missing-module-attribute
os.jongleur()  # missing-attribute
```

Note that objects with type `Any` will never raise this error.

## missing-module-attribute

Arises when attempting to import a name that does not exist from a module.

This is distinct from [`import-error`](#import-error), which is used when the module being imported does not exist, and [`missing-attribute`](#missing-attribute), when access attributes of the module.

```python
import this_does_not_exist  # import-error
import os.bacarat  # import-error
from os import joker  # missing-module-attribute
os.perkeo  # missing-attribute
```

In this example, `os.bacarat` is treated as a module name, so failing to find it results in an `import-error`.
`from os import joker` does not tell us if `joker` is a module, class, function, etc., so it is treated as the more general `missing-module-attribute`.

## no-access

The `no-access` error indicates that an attribute exists, but it cannot be used in this way.

For example, classes do not have access to their instances' attributes:

```python
class Ex:
  def __init__(self) -> None:
    self.meaning: int = 42

del Ex.meaning  # no-access
```

## no-matching-overload

This error is similar to the other bad function call errors, but specifically for cases where a function decorated with `@overload` is called with arguments that do not match any of the overloaded variations.

For example, neither of the signatures of `f` can take an argument of type `float`:

```python
from typing import overload

@overload
def f(x: int) -> int:
    ...

@overload
def f(x: str) -> str:
    ...

def f(x: int | str) -> int | str:
    return x

f(1.0)
```

## not-a-type

This indicates an attempt to use something that isn't a type where a type is expected.
In most cases, a more specific error kind is used.

You may see this error around incorrect type aliases:

```python
class A:
  ...
# Not an alias, just a string!
X = "A"
x: X = ...  # X is not a type alias, so this is illegal
```

## not-callable

A straightforward error: something that is not a function was used as if it were a function.

One interesting place this error may occur is with decorators:

```python
x = 1

@x  # not-callable
def foo() -> None:
  ...
```

## not-iterable

This is most likely to be seen in a `for` loop:

```python
x = 1  # Or some other value
for val in x:  # not-iterable
  ...
```

## parse-error

An error related to parsing or syntax. This covers a variety of cases, such as function calls with duplicate keyword args, some poorly defined functions, and so on.

## read-only

This error indicates that the attribute being accessed does exist but cannot be modified.

For example, a `@property` with no setter cannot be assigned to:

```python
class Ex:
    @property
    def meaning(self) -> int:
        return 42

x = Ex()
x.meaning = 0
```

## reveal-type

Pyrefly uses this error to communicate the output of the [`reveal_type`](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#reveal-type) function.

## type-alias-error

An error related to the definition or usage of a `typing.TypeAlias`. Many of these cases are covered by [`invalid-annotation`](#invalid-annotation), so this error
specifically handles illegal type alias values:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias
x = 2
Bad: TypeAlias = x
```

## typed-dict-key-error

This error arises when `TypedDict`s are used with incorrect keys, such as a key that does not exist in the `TypedDict`.

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class Ex(TypedDict):
    a: int
    b: str

def test(x: Ex) -> None:
    # These two keys don't exist
    x.nope
    x["wrong"]
    # TypedDict keys must be strings!
    x[1]
```

## unbound-name

This error corresponds to the runtime `NameError`, indicating that a variable is referenced but does not exist.

```python
def do_things(stuff: list[int]) -> str:
  ...

do_thing([1, 2])  # typo! Or, unbound-name
```

## unexpected-keyword

A function was called with an extra keyword argument.

```python
def two_args(a: int, b: int) -> int:
  ...

two_args(a=1, b=2, c=3)
```

## unknown-name

`unknown-name` occurs when attempting to load a name from another scope, but the name cannot be found.

```python
def where() -> None:
  # There is no spoon: unknown-name
  global spoon
```

## unsupported-operand

This error arises when attempting to perform an operation between values of two incompatible types.
Since many Python operators are actually syntactic sugar for function calls, many operations will result in [`bad-argument-type`](#bad-argument-type) errors.

An exception is the `in` operator, which fails when looking for a value in something that does not support `in`:

```python
if "hello" in 1:  # int doesn't support `in`!
  ...
```

## unsupported

This error indicates that pyrefly does not currently support a typing feature.

title: Error Suppressions

description: How to suppress errors in Pyrefly
---
import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/sandbox/CodeSnippet'

The Python type system allows you to suppress errors with a comment. This feature can be helpful in many scenarios. For example, after enabling a type checker, suppressions can allow you to get a clean type check signal without having to stop and fix every pre-existing error in your code.

There are mutliple ways to do this in Pyrefly.

```python
def foo() -> int:
  # pyrefly: ignore
  return "this is a type error"
```

You can also put the comment on the same line as the error.

```python
def foo() -> int:
  return "this is a type error" # pyrefly: ignore
```

We respect the specification and allow `type: ignore` to be used:

```python
def foo() -> int:
  return "this is a type error" # type: ignore
```


We also have a special comment that will ignore all errors in a file.


<pre>
  <CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="why_hints.py"
  isCodeSnippet={true}
  codeSample={`# pyrefly: ignore-all-errors

from typing import *


def test(x: int):
  return f"{x}"

def bar() -> int:
    # this error won't be reported
    return ""
`}
  />
</pre>

## Upgrading Pyrefly (And other changes that introduce new type errors)

Upgrading the version of Pyrefly you're using, or a third party library you depend on can surface new type errors in your code. Fixing them all at once is often not realistic. We've written scripts to help you temporarily silence them.

```
# step 1
pyrefly check --suppress-errors
```

```
# step 2
<run your formatter of choice>
```

```
# step 3
pyrefly check --remove-unused-ignores
```
Repeat the steps above until you get a clean fomatting run and a clean type check.

This will add ` # pyrefly: ignore` comments to your code that will enable you to silence errors, and come back and fix them at a later date. This can make the process of upgrading a large codebase much more manageable.

description: How Pyrefly finds and resolves imports
---

# Import Resolution

This doc describes how imports in a given file are found and their bindings are
resolved, including files that are being type checked.

NOTE: This document helps describe the internal behavior of Pyrefly and how we attempt to resolve imports. You should not need to know how this works, to use Pyrefly but may assist in debugging issues with Pyrefly not finding your imports. If you encounter a bug, please leave an issue for us on GitHub.

NOTE: see the [Configuration documentation](./configuration.mdx) for more info on
the config items referenced below.

## Relative Imports

If the import is relative (starting with one or more dots), the import is
resolved relative to the path of the file importing it. A single dot at the
beginning of the import (e.g. `.file.to.import`) represents the current
directory, and more dots (e.g. `..other.file`) will continue to walk upward.

## Absolute Imports

For absolute imports, Pyrefly uses the following import strategy:

1. Try to import from each entry in [`search_path`](./configuration.mdx#search_path) in the order they appear
   using the module finding strategy.
2. Try to import from `typeshed`.
3. Try to import implicit site packages. See the [implicit site packages section](#implicit-search-path)
4. Try to find a stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in
   [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path).
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
4. Try to find a non-stub package corresponding to the import we're trying to resolve in `site_package_path`.
   Entries earlier in the `site_package_path` list will be selected before those appearing later in the list.
5. Return an import error.

See [Site Package Path Typing Rules](#site-package-path-typing-rules) for more information about which
modules are valid imports from [`site_package_path`](./configuration.mdx#site_package_path), and
how to override that behavior.

### Implicit Search Path

Pyrefly will use the following heuristics to guess
the root of your project.

1. If we can find a Pyrefly config file using
   [configuration finding logic](./configuration.mdx#configuration-finding), we will automatically
   use that. When a configuration
   is found, we will add either a subdirectory named `src/`, or the found root as a
   [`search_path`](configuration.mdx#search_path) entry.
2. If we're looking for a specific import and can match components of its specific name
   with directories/files on the filesystem, we will use the root of the import as the
   project root. Example: when importing `from a.b.c import q`, if our project structure
   looks like `/x/y/z/a/b/c`, we can walk up the components of `a.b.c` to find a root at
   `/x/y/z`.
3. If the file we're importing is a non-namespace import, and we can't get it's parent
   directory, return a basic-default config with no heuristics. For example:
   ```
   # Assume we have a file called mymodule.py in the same directory
   import mymodule
   ```
4. Finally, with either the non-namespace import's parent directory or namespace import's
   immediate directory, walk up the filesystem and add each directory we find until
   root to the `fallback_search_path`.

### Site Package Path Typing Rules

When enabled with [`use_untyped_imports: false`](configuration.mdx#use_untyped_imports), we respect
typing rules as defined by the typing spec for
[stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-only-packages),
[partial stubs packages](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#partial-stub-packages),
and [py.typed](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#packaging-type-information) files.
That means:
- if we can find any `-stubs` package, we do not fall back to non-stubs packages unless any of them contain a
  `py.typed` file in their top-level containing the content `partial\n`.
- if we can't find any `-stubs` packages, only accept a package's types if it contains a `py.typed` file. Here,
  we only check for the existence of the file, not for any contents.

You can control the above behavior with the following two configs:
- [`use_untyped_imports`](./configuration.mdx#use_untyped_imports): don't worry about looking for any `py.typed`
  file. Check for `-stubs` first and fall back to non-stubs, regardless of the presence of a `py.typed` with
  `partial\n` or if the non-stubs packages contain a `py.typed`.
- [`ignore_missing_source`](./configuration.mdx#ignore_missing_source): don't try to check for a backing non-stubs
  package when we find a `-stubs` package. Immediately return the `-stubs` package when found.

## Stub Files vs Source Files

A
[stub file](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files)
is any file that ends with a `.pyi` file suffix. They have many uses, including
adding typing to non-Python extension code, distributing typing information
separate from implementation, or overriding an implementation with more accurate
typing information.

A stub package is a second package corresponding to a regular package, with `-stubs`
appended to its name. A `-stubs` package should only include stub files (`.pyi`),
which override any `.py` or `.pyi` files in the non-stubs package. These are preferred
when available, since they contain the interfaces a library exposes to developers. An
example of this includes the popular library [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas),
and its stub package, [`pandas-stubs`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs).

When importing from a non-stubs package, Pyrefly loads typing information from
imports by first searching for a relevant `-stubs` package, then by looking at
the non-stubs package's `.pyi` files, then falls back to a `.py` file. See
[Absolute Imports](#absolute-imports) for details on when non-stubs packages
are allowed to be used for types, and how you can override that behavior.

## Debugging Import Issues

Pyrefly has a `dump-config` command that dumps the import-related config options it is using for
each file it is checking. To use it, simply replace `check` with `dump-config` in your
command-line invocation.

title: Introduction
description: Guides and references for all you need to know about Pyrefly
---

import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/sandbox/CodeSnippet'

Pyrefly is a static type checker for Python that helps you catch type-related errors before your code runs. It analyzes your Python code to ensure type consistency throughout your codebase, making your applications more reliable and easier to maintain. Pyrefly supports both IDE integration and CLI usage, giving you flexibility in how you incorporate type checking into your workflow.

## Benefits of Type Checking

Adding type annotations to your Python code and using a type checker like Pyrefly provides several important benefits:

- **Catch bugs early** - Identify type-related errors during development rather than at runtime
- **Improve code quality** - Type annotations serve as living documentation, making your code more readable and self-documenting
- **Enhance developer experience** - Get better IDE support with accurate autocomplete, refactoring tools, and inline documentation
- **Safer refactoring** - Make large-scale changes with confidence, knowing the type checker will catch incompatible type usage
- **Better collaboration** - Types create clear contracts between different parts of your codebase, making it easier for teams to work together

## Try Pyrefly

Here's a simple example showing how Pyrefly can catch type errors:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="getting_started.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Basic Type Checking

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name

# This works fine since both "World" is a string and greet expects a string
message = greet("World")

# Pyrefly catches this error before runtime due to a type misatch between 42 and "str"
# Error: Argument of type 'int' is not assignable to parameter of type 'str'
error_message = greet(42)
`}
/>

In this example, Pyrefly flags the second call to `greet()` because we're passing an integer (`42`) where a string is expected, helping you catch this issue before your code runs. To learn more about Python typing and how to use it effectively:

title: Installation

description: How to install Pyrefly
---

If you want to experiment with our tool, the easiest way to install Pyrefly is via `pip`.

```
pip install pyrefly
```

Then, `cd` into the directory or project you would like to type check and run

```
pyrefly check
```

You'll want to set up a basic configuration file to type check your project. You can add configuration options to a `pyproject.toml` file, or create a `pyrefly.toml` file in your project directory.

```
[tool.pyrefly]
search_path = [
    "example_directory/..."
]
```

Then, simply run `pyrefly check`, this time the tool will use your configuration options.

It's likely the tool will return a list of type errors, this is perfectly normal. At this point you have a few options:

1. Silence the errors using `# pyrefly: ignore` comments. This will get your project to a clean type checking state and you can drive down the number of errors as you go. We've included a script that can do this for you:

```
pyrefly check --suppress-errors
```
2. Use extra configuration options to silence specific categories of errors, or exclude files with more errors than average.

----
## Upgrading Pyrefly

Upgrading the version of Pyrefly you're using, or a third party library you depend on can surface new type errors in your code. Fixing them all at once is often not realistic. We've written scripts to help you temporarily silence them.

```
# step 1
pyrefly check --suppress-errors
```

```
# step 2
<run your formatter of choice>
```

```
# step 3
pyrefly check --remove-unused-ignores
```
Repeat the steps above until you get a clean formatting run and a clean type check.

This will add ` # pyrefly: ignore` comments to your code that will enable you to silence errors, and come back and fix them at a later date. This can make the process of upgrading a large codebase much more manageable.
----

## Add Pyrefly to CI

Once your project passes type checks without errors, you can ensure no new bugs are introduced. This is best enforced through CI (Continuous Integration) to prevent other maintainers from merging code with errors. Here is an example for GitHub.

Save your workflow in this path in your repository:
```
.github/workflows/typecheck.yml
```

GitHub automatically detects any `.yml` files inside `.github/workflows/` and sets up the defined workflows.

```
name: Pyrefly Type Check

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI

jobs:
  typecheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      # Install Python dependencies and create environment
      - name: Install dependencies and run type checking
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          # Install your dependencies; adjust the following lines as needed
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      - name: Install Pyrefly
        run: pip install pyrefly

      - name: Run Pyrefly Type Checker
        run: pyrefly check
```

### A few notes about this setup:
- Building your environment and installing dependencies will enhance type safety by checking the types of imports. *This is not required, but encouraged!*
- Simply drop in `pyrefly check` to existing workflows that build and test your environment.
```
      - name: Run Pyrefly Type Checker
        run: pyrefly check
```
- Your `pyrefly.toml` or pyrefly configs in your `pyproject.toml` will be automatically detected. Learn how to [configure pyrefly here](../configuration).

title: Migrating from Mypy

description: How to switch from Mypy to Pyrefly
---

## Running Pyrefly

Like mypy, pyrefly can be given a list of files to check:

```sh
$ pyrefly check file1.py file2.py
```

The easiest way to run pyrefly on all files in a project is to run it from the project root:

```sh
$ cd your/project
$ pyrefly check
```

Pyrefly is designed to have sensible defaults, and you may not need to configure it at all.
However, projects with existing mypy configs may want to configure pyrefly to suit their own needs.

## Mypy Config Migration

To make it as easy as possible to get started with pyrefly, we've provided a script for automatically migrating a mypy config to pyrefly.

```sh
$ pyrefly init path/to/your/project
```

This will search for an existing `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` with a `tool.mypy` section, and then transform it into a `pyrefly.toml` (or `[tool.pyrefly]` section) while preserving as many options as possible. See `init --help` for more options.

We do recommend checking the resulting config for errors. While there is some overlap between mypy's config options and pyrefly's config options, it's not always possible to cleanly translate one config option to another.

If you'd rather start fresh with a hand-written config, please see the [pyrefly configuration docs](configuration.mdx), or consider running `pyrefly init` (without `--migrate`!) to generate a basic config.
If you run into any issues with config migration, please [let us know](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues)!

### Config Migration Details

`files`, `modules`, and `packages` are combined into `project_includes`. This should work exactly the same for `files` and `packages`. Mypy doesn't recurse into `modules`, but pyrefly will.

Pyrefly makes an effort to transform the `exclude` regex into a list of filepath globs for `project_excludes`. This should excel on simple regexes, such as `some/file.py|exclude_dir/`, which becomes `["**/some/file.py", "**/exclude_dir/"]`.

The `ignore_missing_imports` per-module config option is turned into a list of modules. For example:

```ini
[mypy-some.*.module]
ignore_missing_imports = True
```

Becomes:

```toml
replace_imports_with_any = ["some.*.module"]
```

Mypy's `follow_imports = "skip"` is handled the same way.

Pyrefly does support mypy's [module name pattern syntax](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#config-file-format): see [Module Globbing](configuration.mdx#module-globbing) in the configuration docs.

Mypy's `follow_untyped_imports` option is allowed to be global or per-module. The pyrefly equivalent, `use_untyped_imports`, is only global. This setting defaults to `true` unless
the `follow_untyped_imports` is disabled in the `[mypy]` section of the migrated config.

### Mypy Error Codes and Pyrefly Error Kinds

Pyrefly maps Mypy's [error codes](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list.html) to equivalent pyrefly [error kinds](error-kinds.mdx).
While not every error code has an equivalent error kind, we make an effort to ensure that pyrefly suppresses the same errors that mypy does.

This may lead to overly broad error suppressions, and you may want to consider removing some error kinds from the disable list.
You can also use a [SubConfig](configuration.mdx#sub_config) to selectively silence errors in specific files,
or see [Silencing Errors](#silencing-errors) for how to suppress errors at the source.

See [Error Kind Mapping](#error-kind-mapping) for a table showing the relationship between type check diagnostic settings and error kinds.

### Per-Module configs

Mypy's per-module configs let you change a wide range of configuration options for modules matching a module wildcard.
Pyrefly's [SubConfigs](configuration.mdx#sub_config) are a similar mechanism that let you configure pyrefly's behavior for files matching a filepath glob.
However, they support significantly fewer options, and only `disable_error_code` and `enable_error_code` will be migrated over to the pyrefly config.

## Silencing Errors

Like mypy, pyrefly has ways to silence specific error codes. Full details can be found in the [Error Suppression docs](error-suppressions.mdx)

To silence an error on a specific line, add a disable comment above that line:

```
# pyrefly: ignore
x: str = 1
```

To suppress all instances of an error, disable that error in the config:

```
[errors]
import-error = false
```

This is equivalent to mypy's `disable_error_code`, though of course the [error codes](error-kinds.mdx) are different!

### Error Kind Mapping


This table shows the mapping between mypy's [error codes](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list.html) and pyrefly's [error kinds](error-kinds.mdx).

This table will be expanded as more diagnostics are supported.

title: Migrating from Pyright

description: How to switch from Pyright to Pyrefly
---

## Running Pyrefly

Like pyright, pyrefly can be given a list of files to check:

```sh
$ pyrefly check file1.py file2.py
```

The easiest way to run pyrefly on all files in a project is to run it from the project root:

```sh
$ cd your/project
$ pyrefly check
```

Pyrefly doesn't need a config file to start checking your code. Its sensible defaults are designed to work well for most projects.
However, projects with existing pyright configs may want to configure pyrefly to suit their own needs.

## Pyright Config Migration

To make it as easy as possible to get started with pyrefly, we've provided a script for automatically migrating a pyright config to pyrefly.

```sh
$ pyrefly init path/to/your/project
```

This will search for an existing `pyrightconfig.json` or `pyproject.toml` with a `tool.pyright` section, and then transform it into a `pyrefly.toml` (or `[tool.pyrefly]` section) while preserving as many options as possible. See `init --help` for more options.

There is a significant overlap between pyright's and pyrefly's configuration options, so migration is pretty straightforward. However, it may be worth checking the generated config for errors, just in case.

If you'd rather start fresh with a hand-written config, please see the [pyrefly configuration docs](configuration.mdx), or consider running `pyrefly init` (without `--migrate`!) to generate a basic config.
If you run into any issues with config migration, please [let us know](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues)!

## Config Migration Details

When it comes to listing files, pyright uses just paths, while pyrefly supports glob patterns. Thankfully, paths are a subset of glob patterns, so pyrefly can just use the paths as-is. You could consider manually simplifying the paths into glob patterns, but it's not necessary.

Pyright supports four platforms: Windows, Linux, Darwin (macOS), and All. Since pyrefly only supports Python's [supported platforms](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform), we choose to treat "All" as "linux".

### Type Check Diagnostic Settings and Error Kinds

Pyrefly maps pyright's [type check diagnostics settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-diagnostics-settings) to equivalent pyrefly [error kinds](error-kinds.mdx).
While not every diagnostic setting has an equivalent error kind, we make an effort to ensure that pyrefly suppresses the same errors that pyright does.

This may lead to overly broad error suppressions, and you may want to consider removing some error kinds from the disable list.
You can also use a [SubConfig](configuration.mdx#sub_config) to selectively silence errors in specific files,
or see [Silencing Errors](#silencing-errors) for how to suppress errors at the source.

See [Error Kind Mapping](#error-kind-mapping) for a table showing the relationship between type check diagnostic settings and error kinds.

### Execution Environments

Pyright's [execution environments](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=execution-environment-options) let you customize the Python version, platform, module search paths, and diagnostic settings for some part of your project.
Pyrefly's [SubConfigs](configuration.mdx#sub_config) are a similar mechanism that let you configure pyrefly's behavior for files matching a filepath glob.
However, subconfigs do not support changing the Python version, platform, or module search paths.

Diagnostic settings are carried over to the equivalent subconfig, using the mapping mentioned [above](#type-check-diagnostic-settings-and-error-kinds).

## Silencing Errors

Like pyright, pyrefly has ways to silence specific error codes. Full details can be found in the [Error Suppression docs](error-suppressions.mdx).

To silence an error on a specific line, add a disable comment above that line:

```
# pyrefly: ignore
x: str = 1
```

To suppress all instances of an error, disable that error in the config:

```
[errors]
import-error = false
```

This is similar to pyright's [type check rule overrides](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-rule-overrides), though of course the [error codes](error-kinds.mdx) are different!

## Error Kind Mapping

This table shows the mapping between pyright's [type check diagnostics settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-diagnostics-settings)
and pyrefly's [error kinds](error-kinds.mdx).

This table will be expanded as more diagnostics are supported.

    Frequently Asked Questions about Pyrefly, a PEP 484 compliant Type Checker for
    Python and IDE extension.
---

# Pyrefly Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I pronounce Pyrefly?

It's pronounced PIE-ur-fly, rhyming with "firefly."

### What is the relationship to Pyre?

Pyrefly is a ground-up rebuild that doesn’t share any core type checking code with Pyre. Not only is Pyrefly written in a new language (Rust instead of OCaml), but its design deviates in a major way from [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/). Rust enables us to deliver substantial performance improvements and support multiple operating systems (including Windows). Beyond the core type checker itself, there are helper tooling and many lessons learned that we will take from Pyre and the community of Python type checking maintainers who have done tremendous work to get the state of type checking to where it is today.

### Yet another Type Checker! Why not improve the ones adopted by the community already?

We are standing on the shoulders of giants. The contributions to Python typing by Mypy, Pyright, Pytype, Pyre and others have been invaluable. We borrowed concepts and learned from them as we rolled our own. Open source conformance matters to us a lot. While we might make some opinionated decisions, we'll adhere to the PEP process. Pyre was the only type checker that could scale for Meta’s needs and was starting to show its age, so we started with a ground-up rewrite aimed at usability and performance.

We built a custom engine for incremental computation and designed our type-checking algorithm based on years of experience in gradual typing theory and Rust expertise. By open-sourcing this technology we hope it can serve projects of any size well.

### Why Rust?

We would have preferred to write Pyrefly in Python, but we didn't think we could hit our ambitious performance goals using Python today (hopefully future work around free-threaded Python and JIT changes that). After ruling out Python, we wanted something that was safe, cross-platform, compiled to WASM (for a Playground experience). Rust and Go are probably the best choices for those goals, and our team at Meta had more experience with Rust.

### Do you plan to build an LSP?

Yes. See our [roadmap](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/milestone/1) for details.

### Where do I report bugs?

Please open an [issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) page. You can leave feature requests there as well :) Our current goal is to get through our first major milestone, and after that we can look at bugs and features beyond the current roadmap.

### Can I contribute to Pyrefly?

Please see the: [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How do I know this project won't go unmaintained after a year?

Great question. We have made a substantial investment in Pyrefly, use it internally and aligned open source maintainability as a key principle for starting this project in the first place. We’re in it for the long haul. Using it is the best way to encourage further investment from our leadership.

### This is cool, I want to learn more about the technical details.

See our [README.md](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/README.md) for the high level design. We plan to add more detailed documentation along with announcements on [https://engineering.fb.com](https://engineering.fb.com/)

### I don't like Python's Type System. Stop wasting your time.

Tell us more - seriously! We want to hear your objections to typing. We hope that better tooling, improvements to the type system and well typed libraries will help provide make development easier. If all else fails our fast code navigation and inference algorithm might spark joy in your IDE, so give us a chance.

# Python Typing for New Developers

*A beginner‑friendly guide to adding type hints in Python.*

**Note:** This tutorial assumes you understand some basic Python syntax, but are new to programming or type hints. To learn more about Python, see the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and [Getting Started Guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)

## 1. What is a Type Hint in Python?

A type hint in Python is a way to indicate the expected data type of a variable, function parameter, or return value. It's a hint to other developers (and to tools like type checkers and IDEs) about what type of data should be used with a particular piece of code.

Type hints are **not enforced at runtime by Python itself,** but they can be used by third-party tools (like Pyrefly) to catch type-related errors before your code runs. They also serve as documentation, making it easier for others to understand how to use your code.
Here's an example of a simple function with type hints:

```
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## 2. Why Bother with Type Hints?

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you can write code without declaring types. However, this can lead to bugs or ambiguity in your code.

_TL;DR_
* Catch bugs **before** running the code.
* Improve editor autocomplete & refactors.
* Turn your code into living documentation.


<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="why_hints.py"
  codeSample={`# Without hints – is "times" a str, int, or list?
def repeat(text, times):
    return text * times

# With hints – intent is crystal clear.
def repeat(text: str, times: int) -> str:
    return text * times
`}
/>


### Can you spot the bug?

```
class Rectangle:
    width: int
    height: int

    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int) -> None:
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

rect = Rectangle(width=100, height=50)

area = rect.width * rect.hieght

print(area)
```


**Spelling is hard!** Let's add the `dataclass` decorator to our class definition. This will generate a constructor for us, and also add a few other useful methods.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="misspelled.py"
  codeSample={`#Pyrefly will catch this spelling error before you run the code
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    width: int
    height: int

rect = Rectangle(width=100, height=50)

area = rect.width * rect.hieght
`}
/>


## 3. Primitive Types

Since Python 3.9 you can use all the [primitive types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) directly as annotations.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="primitives_types.py"
  codeSample={`age: int = 30
height: float = 1.85
name: str = "Tyler Typer"
is_admin: bool = False
`}
/>

You can also specify a parameter as optional by using `Optional` type, or now with the `| None` syntax.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="primitive2_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Optional typing example

from typing import Optional

middle_name: Optional[str] = None        # classic
nickname: str | None = None              # 3.10+ shorthand
`}
/>

## 4. Collections

### Syntax	Examples
- List of numbers	`list[int]	scores: list[int] = [98, 87, 91]`
- Tuple of two floats	`tuple[float, float]	point: tuple[float, float] = (3.0, 4.0)`
- Dict of str -> int	`dict[str, int]	inventory: dict[str, int] = {"apples": 5}`
- Set of strings	`set[str]	authors: set[str] = {"Bob", "Eve"}`

Since Python 3.9 you can subscript built‑ins directly—no need for `from typing import List`.

## 5. Functions
<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="basic_function_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Simple function
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
  `}
/>
Default values keep their annotation:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="default_value_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Function with default value


def greet(name: str, polite: bool = True) -> str:
    return "Hello!" if polite else f"Yo {name}"
    `}
/>
Variable‑length arguments:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="variable_length_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Variable length functions
from collections.abc import Callable

Logger = Callable[[str], None]

def debug(*msgs: str, log: Logger | None = print) -> None:
  for m in msgs:
    if log is not None:
      log(m)
    else:
      print(m)
    `}
/>

## 6. Get Type Hint Signals Directly in Your Editor

You can download the [Pyrefly extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly) to get type hint signals directly in your IDE.

Next, install [Pyrefly](../installation/) and check some code:
```
# Fast, zero‑config
pip install pyrefly

pyrefly check ./my_sample.py

# Check whole directories
pyrefly check app/ tests/
```

Create a `pyrefly.toml` file to configure your project. Instructions [here](../configuration).

# Typing for Python Developers

*A 5‑Minute Tour with Pyrefly.*

**Goal:** In five minutes you'll know how Python's static type system _infers_, _defines_, and _composes_ types—and you'll have copy‑paste snippets to start using right away.

If you are new to Python, check out our [Python Typing for New Developers guide](../python-typing-for-beginners/).

Python's type system allows you to annotate variables so you, your teammates and your type checker can find bugs before you run your code. Think of it as documentation that's automatically validated and will help your IDE help you.

_TL;DR_
* Catch bugs **before** running the code.
* Improve editor autocomplete & refactors.
* Turn your code into living documentation.

### Types with Inference

Static analyzers can often _infer_ types from your code—no annotations required. Pyrefly takes this a step further.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="basic_inference.py"
  codeSample={`# Basic Inference
answer = 42
reveal_type(answer) # hover to reveal type

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
scores = {"math": 95, "science": 90}

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("World")
`}
/>

### Where Inference Shines ✨
- Constant assignments (`answer = 42 -> int`)
- List/tuple/dict literals with uniform elements (`names = ["A", "B"] -> list[str]`)
- Return types if parameter types are annotated:

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="return_inference.py"
  codeSample={`def add(a: int, b: int):   # ✅ param annotations
    return a + b    # 🔍 return inferred -> int
`}
/>

### When to Add Hints
- Public APIs (library or service boundaries)
- Mixed collections (`list[int | str]`)
- Callable signatures (decorators, callbacks)

## Define Types Inline

### The Basics

Python's built-in types can be used to write many type hints.
<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="built_in_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Basic Types

from typing import reveal_type

age: int = 5
reveal_type(age) # revealed type: int

age = "oops"

name: str = "John"
reveal_type(name) # revealed type: str

numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
reveal_type(numbers) # revealed type: list[int]

names: list[str] = ["John", "Jane"]
reveal_type(names) # revealed type: list[str]

person: dict[str, str] = {"name": "John", "age": "30"}
reveal_type(person) # revealed type: dict[str, str]

is_admin = True
reveal_type(is_admin) # revealed type: Literal[True]
`}
/>

### Functions
Defining the parameter and return types for a function doesn't just help prevent bugs, but it makes it easier to navigate in other files. You don't always need to define a return type - we'll do our best to infer it for you! We can't always get it right and an explicit return type will help your IDE navigate faster and more accurately.
<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="functions_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Functions

from typing import reveal_type

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

greet("Pyrefly")

def whatDoesThisFunctionReturnAgain(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b

reveal_type(whatDoesThisFunctionReturnAgain(2, 3)) # revealed type: int
`}
/>

## Advanced Types

### Composing Types
The real power comes from composing smaller pieces into richer shapes.

### Unions & Optional
<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="unions_types.py"
  codeSample={`# Union and Optional Types

from typing import Optional

def to_int(data: str | bytes | None) -> Optional[int]:
    if data is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(data, bytes):
        data = data.decode()
    return int(data)
`}
/>

### Generics

Generics allow you to define reusable functions and classes that work with multiple types. This feature enables you to write more flexible and adaptable code.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="generics.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Generic Classes

from typing import reveal_type

class C[T]:
    def __init__(self, x: T):
        self.x = x
    def box(self) -> list[T]:
        return [self.x]

c = C(0)
reveal_type(c.box())  # revealed type: list[int]
`}
/>

### Protocols

Protocols enable structural typing, which allows you to define interfaces without explicit inheritance. This feature helps you write more modular and composable code.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="protocols.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Structural Typing with Protocols

from typing import Iterable, Protocol

class Writer(Protocol):
    def write(self) -> None: ...

class GoodWorld:
    def write(self) -> None:
        print("Hello world!")

class BadWorld:
    pass

def f(writer: Writer):
    pass

f(GoodWorld()) # OK
f(BadWorld())  # ERROR!
`}
/>

## Structural Types
Python also employs a structural type system, often referred to as "duck typing." This concept is based on the idea that if two objects have the same shape or attributes, they can be treated as being of the same type.

### Dataclasses

Dataclasses allow you to create type-safe data structures while minimizing boilerplate.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="data_classes.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Dataclasses

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

Point(x=0.0, y=0.0)    # OK
Point(x=0.0, y="oops") # ERROR!
`}
/>


### TypedDict

Typed dictionaries enable you to define dictionaries with specific key-value types. This feature lets you bring type safety to ad-hoc dictionary structures without major refactoring.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="typed_dict.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: TypedDict

from typing import TypedDict

class Movie(TypedDict):
    name: str
    year: int

good_movie: Movie = {"name": "Toy Story", "year": 1995} # OK
bad_movie: Movie = {"name": "The Room", "year": "2003"}  # ERROR!
`}
/>

### Overloads

Overloads allow you to define multiple function signatures for a single function. Like generics, this feature helps you write more flexible and adaptable code.

<CodeSnippet
  sampleFilename="overloads.py"
  codeSample={`# Example: Overloads

from typing import overload, reveal_type

@overload
def f(x: int) -> int: ...

@overload
def f(x: str) -> str: ...

def f(x: int | str) -> int | str:
    return x

reveal_type(f(0))  # revealed type: int
reveal_type(f("")) # revealed type: str
`}
/>
